Project Ttile: Detect Pixelated Image and Correct it

Brief about the project:
Pixelation in images occurs when low-resolution images are enlarged. This results in blocky and distorted visuals that degrade overall quality of te image. Here, the challenge is to develop a robust algorithm that can automatically detect pixelation in images and then apply necessary corrections to enhance the imageâ€™s clarity and accuracy.

This is done by using various Correction Techniques:
1. Super-Resolution Methods
2. Edge Enhancement
3. Texture Synthesis 

Quality Assessment Metrics:
1. PSNR
2. SSIM
3. Perceptual Metrics

Tools and Technology Used:
Python (Programming Language)
Modules used:
1. OpenCV
2. Numpy 
3. Tenserflow
4. Keras

Features:
1. Detection of Pixelation
2. Correction of Pixelated Regions
3. Scalability and Efficiency
4. Quality Assessment
5. Machine Learning Models
6. Real-Time Capabilities
7. Adaptability and Versatility
8. Robustness
